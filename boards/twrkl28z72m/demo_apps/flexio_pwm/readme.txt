Overview
========
This demo describes how to use SDK drivers to implement the PWM feature by FLEXIO IP module.
It outputs the PWM singal with fixed frequency defined by "DEMO_FLEXIO_FREQUENCY" in source code
and dynamic duty from 99 to 1 to one of the FLEXIO pin.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.2
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- TWR-KL28Z72M board
- Personal Computer
- Primary Elevator Tower

Board settings
==============
Use oscilloscope to measure output signal pin at A9-Elevator board.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you can see the GREEN LED from dim to light.Use oscilloscope to check the waveform.
And these messages are displayed/shown on the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
FLEXIO_PWM demo start.
